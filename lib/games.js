In this game, you are the most annoying bird in the world. You spend your days amusing yourself by dive-bombing humans. It's really a lot of fun! See what happens if you hit them in the face.\n\n\

Add to the fun by collecting power ups! Old burritos give you a fart boost. Candy bars give you a sugar rush. Eating worms gives you more .... em ... ammo. And, discarded laxatives makes your ammo go further.",
